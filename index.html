    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>My name is James and I am 31 years old and have recently left my role of more than 12 years as a payroll and HR administrator in pursuit of a new challenge. <br/> 
    My reason for this is I feel like I could have more to offer in a more demanding role in the future and I am displaying this by enrolling this year on a 3 year IT degree course at the Open university.</p>
